# WendzelNNTPd

The WendzelNNTPd is an IPv6-ready Usenet server (NNTP daemon) with the main goal to maximize usability on the console level. WendzelNNTPd achieves that by breaking down complicated things to an easy-to-use configuration file + tool. The server is portable (Linux/*BSD/*nix), supports AUTHINFO authentication, contains support for Access Control Lists (ACL), role based access control (RBAC) and supports invisible newsgroups. It currently allows MySQL and SQLite backends
